Slick extensions for MySQL8

This package is based on 
[slick-pg](https://github.com/tminglei/slick-pg) which brings addional support for different data structures to slick.

Currently the package supports only [Spatial Data Types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-types.html) features that came along with MySQL 8.
